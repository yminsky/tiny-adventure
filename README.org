#+TITLE: Tiny Adventure

This is a work in progress, a very small adventure game, mostly made
for the purposes of playing with my kids. Really, there's almost
nothing here...

If you want to understand the basic structure, a good place to start
is =state.ml=, which is the basic data structure that tracks
everything about the game.

This is build against a bleeding edge versions of [[https://github.com/janestreet/base][Base]], so you'll need
to do something like this to get the right versions in OPAM.
